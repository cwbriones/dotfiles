Vim files
=========

This is a backup of my .vimrc as well as my vim plugins through the use
of git submodules. Almost everything should work right away with pathogen, 
although you need to compile youcomplete.

To install (or update) pathogen to .vim/autoload
`
curl -Sso ~/.vim/autoload/pathogen.vim \
    https://raw.github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen-master/autoload/pathogen.vim
`

Make sure to symlink ~/.vimrc to ~/.vim/vimrc.
